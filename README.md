# Open Accessibility Framework (OAF) for Web Applications

The document in this repository describes the OAF as it applies to 
Web Applications.

## Background

The **Open Accessibility Framework** was originally developed in the context
of the European research & development project 
[AEGIS](http://www.aegis-project.eu/), 
which ran from September 2008 till August 2012
and was funded by the European Commission as part of the 
7th Framework Programme (FP7) under project number 224348. 

See the [main OAF repository](https://github.com/cstrobbe/OAF)
